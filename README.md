# VoxelEngine
Research into Minecraft-style voxel engines. Done primarily in Unity as the aim was to explore the data structures and algorithms more so than the lower-level internals of a game engine.

## NOTICE
This repo is no longer being maintained. I am currently working on a clean-slate successor to this project that will primarily focus on full RGB lighting and efficient meshing.
The new project solves many of the issues plaguing this one and should serve as a better foundation for Minecraft-style voxel game projects.

## Current Features
- Multithreaded chunk pipeline.
- Rough atlas generation at runtime from individual textures.
- Minecraft-style voxel lighting.

## Credits
Textures used are from the Pixel Perfection texture pack by XSSheep.
