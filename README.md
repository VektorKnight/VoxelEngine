# VoxelEngine
Research into Minecraft-style voxel engines. Done primarily in Unity as the aim was to explore the data structures and algorithms more so than the lower-level internals of a game engine.

My apologies to anyone finding this repository. While I do think some portions of this project may be useful to some, Im generally not happy with the code. 

I also originally had no intent of releasing this publically so please excuse the nonsensical commit summaries. Maybe sometime in the future Ill pick this project back up or reimplement it in a cleaner and more structured way.
